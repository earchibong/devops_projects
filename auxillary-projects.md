# Shell Scripting.
# This script will read a CSV file that contains 20 new Linux users.
# This script will create each user on the server and add to an existing group called 'Developers'.
# This script will first check for the existence of the user on the system, before it will attempt to create that it.
# The user that is being created also must also have a default home folder
# Each user should have a .ssh folder within its HOME folder. If it does not exist, then it will be created.
# For each userâ€™s SSH configuration, We will create an authorized_keys file and add the below public key.
